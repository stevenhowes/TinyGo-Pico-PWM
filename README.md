# TinyGo-Pico-PWM
A working example of PWM for the Pi Pico using TinyGo.

I was frustraded by various examples (includig the official docs) being wrong for the Pico so I decided to make my own. It flashes the onboard LED in a 'breathe' pattern.

Makefile included, so you can 'make install', alternatively:

tinygo flash -target=pico
